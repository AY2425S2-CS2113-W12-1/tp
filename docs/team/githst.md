### Project: Modmate

Modmate is a command-line application that helps keep track of your timetables and modules at NUS. It is a very simple way to keep yourself always on track with your classes at NUS.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Designed and integrated the `HPPTUtil` and `NusModsAPI` classes
  * What it does: Enables efficient, modular retrieval and formatting of data from the NUSMods public API, encapsulating network logic and result parsing.
  * Highlights: Modular and testable design, allowing future extensions such as caching or additional endpoints.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2425s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=githst)

* **Project management**:
  * Set up initial code templates and structure for commands and fetchers.
  * Wrote base logging utility (`Logger`) to ensure consistent and easily configurable log output across the application.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Refactored internal command structure for improved extensibility and separation of concerns.
  * Improved error feedback to users when invalid module codes or commands are entered.

* **Documentation**:
  * Developer Guide:
    * Documented the design and implementation of the `viewmod` command.
    * Included class diagrams and detailed descriptions of the `HTTPUtil` and `NusModsAPI` utility classes.
