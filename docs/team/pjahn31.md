### Project: Modmate

Modmate is a command-line application that helps keep track of your timetables and modules at NUS. It is a very simple way to keep yourself always on track with your classes at NUS.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a `createtimetable` command that allows the user to create a timetable [#21](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/21)
  * What it does: allows the user to create a timetable with their desired timetable name, user can create multiple timetables

* **New Feature**: Added a `timetable` command that allows the user to view their created timetable [#21](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/21)
  * What it does: displays the timetable that the user wants to view, it can display the modules that the user has added to the respective timetable

* **Test Cases**: Added test cases for classes `CondensedMod`, `Mod`, `Schedule`, `User` [#58](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/58)
  * These classes are the foundation of our code, out of which the rest of our code builds upon

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2425s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=w12-1)

* **Project management**:
  * Assisted in guiding the team towards delivering v2.0 on schedule with good quality
  * Ensured good communication en route delivery of v2.1

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Implemented a modular command pattern architecture [#77](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/77)
    * Decoupled command logic into discrete, single-responsibility classes
    * Designed with extensibility in mind - new commands can be added without modifying existing code
    * Code is now easier to read

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the feature `viewallmods` [#114](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-W12-1/tp/pull/104)
